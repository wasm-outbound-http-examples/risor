## Instructions for this devcontainer

### Preparation

1. Open this repo in devcontainer, e.g. using Github Codespaces.
   Type or copy/paste following commands to devcontainer's terminal.

### Building

1. `cd` into the folder of this example:

```sh
cd browser
```

2. Install Risor as library:

```sh
go get github.com/risor-io/risor
```

3. Compile the example:

```sh
GOOS=js GOARCH=wasm go build -o main.wasm main.go
```

4. Copy the glue JS from Golang distribution to example's folder:

```sh
cp "$(go env GOROOT)/misc/wasm/wasm_exec.js" .
```

### Test with browser

1. Run simple HTTP server to temporarily publish project to Web:

```sh
python3 -m http.server
```

Codespace will show you "Open in Browser" button. Just click that button or
obtain web address from "Forwarded Ports" tab.

2. As `index.html` and a **14M**-sized `main.wasm` are loaded into browser, refer to browser developer console
   to see the results.
